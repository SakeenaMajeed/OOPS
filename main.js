// 1. Encapsulation: Binding data and functions into a single unit (object).
// 2. Abstraction: Hiding internal details and showing only essential features.
// 3. Inheritance: Creating new classes based on existing ones.
// 4. Polymorphism: Objects can take on many forms.
// OOP aims to make code more reusable, maintainable, and easier to reason about by organizing it into modular, self-contained objects."
